# Chatterbox

Chatterbox is a MERN stack chat application that utilizes SocketIO for real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication.

Within this project I was able to delve into numerous concepts surrounding REST API's, persisting data to a database, managing user sessions, user authentication, form validation, password hashing, and I'm sure some a few other things I'm forgetting!

I decided to bootstrap the front-end with Create React App rather than using a traditional MVC design pattern because, frankly, I enjoy writing React. Though, I have worked with Pug previously to render view files.
